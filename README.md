# Robot Gladiators

## JavaScript created game that simulates a robot battlefield simulator

This application is an all JavaScript, prompt-based game that is user interactive. It prompts the user to enter their robot's name and then proceeds to prompt the user options on how to play the game. The player must survive 3 consecutive fights against other robots, with the option to skip or fight each round. The player can enter the store between rounds to upgrade their attack, or refill their health, at a cost. If the user makes it the end of the game without dying, they win!
